//Strict Equality Operator (Type + Value) checks whether has same type and same value

// console.log(1 === 1);
// console.log('1' === 1);


//Lose Equality Operator
console.log(1 == 1); 
console.log('1' == 1); //it automatically converts the value



/*
The strict equality operator ensures that both
values have same type and the same value.
The lose equality operator doesn't care about the types matching, 
if the types don't match, it will convert the type of what we have
on right side to match on the left side.
And then it will only check if the values are equal.
