Oop is a programming paradigm centered around objects rather 
than functions.

 Encapsulation  -       group related variables and function together, 
                        this way we can reduce complexity, we can now 
                        reuse the object in different parts of the program, 
                        or in different programs
 Absration      -       we hide the details and the complexity and show 
                        only the essentials. it reduces the complexity and 
                        also isolates the impact of changes in the code. 
 Inheritance    -       We can eliminate redundant code
 Polymorphism   -       Refactor ugly switch case statements


 Before oop we had procedural programming where we have data 
 stored in bunch of variables and functions that operate on 
 the data.
