/*In Javascript there are 2 ways to declare a function
we can use 
- Function Declaration
ex: function sayHello(){}
- Function Expression 
ex: const sayGoodbye = function(){};


the key differece between both is that 
function declaration is hoisted, they are raised to the 
top of the code

*/


//Class Declaration
/*
class Circle{

}

//Class Expression

const Square = class {

};


they are not hoisted
